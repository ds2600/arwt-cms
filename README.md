# ARWT-CMS

## Description

ARWT (Amateur Radio Website Template) was always meant to be a dead simple web template to allow fellow amateur radio operators to spruce up their - historically - terrible websites. As I started getting into it more and more, I realized that adding the functionality that I wanted would take it beyond "dead simple". I decided to create a fork to handle the more advanced features (memberships, blogging, etc).
